As stated on the **Conda** `documentation <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_ ::

>> Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them.
>> It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

This solution was therefore used to deploy the **StatisKit** software suite on all systems.

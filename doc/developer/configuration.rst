Configuration
#############

In order to ease the development of this software suite on multiple operating systems, the **Conda** package and environment management system is used.

.. note::

    If the **Sublime Text** `software <https://www.sublimetext.com/3>`_ is installed on your computer, a :code:`SCons.sublime-build` file will be installed in order to enable the usage of **SCons** directly from within **Sublime Text** projects.

.. warning::

    These scripts use scripts presented in the ref:`section-user-install_it-prerequisites` section, there are therefore no need to run these scripts beforehand.
    Nevertheless, refers to the :ref:`section-user-install_it-prerequisites` sectionÂ to configure the following script executions.

To install **Conda** and the development environment on:

* Linux and OS X, download the following :download:`script <developer_install.sh>`.
  Then, open a shell in the same directory and type the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash
    
        source developer_install.sh

* Windows, download the following :download:`script <developer_install.bat>`.
  Then, open a shell in the same directory and type the following command:

  .. code-block:: batch

        call developer_install.bat

Afterwards, the `statiskit-dev <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StatisKit/StatisKit/master/conda/statiskit-dev.yml>`_ environment is installed and you can activate it by typing in the same shell:

* On Linux and OS X, 

  .. code-block:: console

      source activate statiskit-dev

* On windows, 

  .. code-block:: console

      activate statiskit-dev

Fork and/or clone a repository
##############################

To fork and/or clone a repository of the **StatisKit** organization, we recommend to use the :code:`statiskit clone` command.
To perform these steps, :code:`statiskit clone` uses the PyGithub package to access `GitHub` interface in `Python`.
Your gitHub credentials (<username> and <password>) are therefore required .

.. code-block:: console

    $ statiskit clone
    Username for 'https://github.com': <username>
    Password for 'https://pfernique@github.com': <password>
    
Let us consider a repository identified by :code:`<reponame>`

.. code-block:: console

    Enter a repository name: <reponame>
    
This command:

1. Fork the :code:`<reponame>` into your account.

   .. warning::
   
        The :code:`<reponame>` must exists in the **StatisKit** organization.

   .. note::
        
        If you already forked the :code:`<reponame>` it will not be forked one more time.

2. Clone it on your disk at your current location within the :code:`<reponame>` directory.

   .. warning::

        If your fork of the :code:`<reponame>` repository is not named :code:`<reponame>`, Its name will be used in place of :code:`<reponame>` for the directory that contains the clone.
        
    
   .. note::
    
        By default, the clone is performed using SSH remote url. 
        If you prefer to use the HTTPS remote url, use the :code:`url` argument of the :code:`statiskit clone` command:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ statiskit clone --url=https
        
3. Add the :code:`upstream` remote that refers to the repository on the **StatisKit** organization.
   
   .. note::
   
        By default, the :code:`origin` remote refers to the repository on your account.

    :alt: Repository status after fork and clone steps.

    Repository status after fork and clone of a repository. 
    
    The repository is named :code:`<reponame>`.
    The left hand cloud represents the repository on the **StatisKit** organization `GitHub` account. 
    The right hand clound represents the forked repository on your :code:`<username>` `GitHub` account.
    The computer represents the cloned repository on your computer.
    
    .. note::
    
        Cloning a repository using **Git** only adds the :code:`origin` remote.
        The principale value added of the :code:`statiskit clone` command is to add the :code:`upstream` remote.
        For example, this enable you to compare your local branch to both remote branches using:
    
        * for the remote branch on the **StatisKit** `GitHub` account,
    
          .. code-block:: console
    
                $ git diff upstream/master 
        
        * for the remote branch on your :code:`<username>` `GitHub` account,
    
          .. code-block:: console
    
                $ git diff origin/master
        
          Or, since :code:`origin` is chosen by default,
      
          .. code-block:: console
    
                $ git diff master

Contribute to a repository
##########################

When using **Git** you should constently keep in mind the following warning:

.. warning::
    
    Never work on master, always on a branch

In order to contribute to an official repository of **StatisKit** we therefore recommand to follow the following workflow.

.. _contribute-workflow:

.. blockdiag::
    :align: center
    :desctable:
    
    blockdiag {

                        to enable code review from mainteners, the |br|
                        development must be short (i.e. one branch for one |br|
                        task such as new feature, bug fix...)."];
        B [label = "Work", shape="roundedbox",

                        ensure code quality, the development must respect |br|
                        some guidelines."];

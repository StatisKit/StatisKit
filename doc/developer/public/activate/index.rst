These services are:

* **Coveralls**.
  This `service <https://coveralls.zendesk.com/hc/en-us>`_ is used to show which parts of your code aren't covered by repository `test suites <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_suite>`_.
* **Landscape**.
  This `service <https://docs.landscape.io/index.html>`_ is used to perform `static analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis>`_ of your code within repositories.

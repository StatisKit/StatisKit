Configure your Computer
#######################

In order to ease the development of the **StatisKit** software suite on multiple operating systems, the **Conda** package and environment management system is used.
To install **Conda** refer to the section :ref:`section-user-install-prerequisites`.

Once **Conda** is installed, you need to create a development environment called :code:`statiskit` containing the meta-package :code:`statiskit` on your computer.
To do so, type the following command line
  
.. code-block:: console

   conda create -n statiskit-toolchain statiskit-toolchain -c statiskit -c defaults --override-channels

.. warning::

   On Windows OSes you must first download and install **Visual Studio Community 2017** (available on this `page <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_).

Then, to activate the :code:`statiskit` environment for each build of **StatisKit** software suite components, type the following command line

.. code-block:: console

  conda activate statiskit-toolchain

.. note::

   If you want a fine grained configuration, report to the :ref:`section-developer-faq` section.

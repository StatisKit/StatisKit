Install it !
############

.. _section-user-install-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

In order to ease the installation of the **StatisKit** software suite on multiple operating systems, the **Conda** package and environment management system is used.

.. note::

    For more information refers to the **Conda** `documentation <http://conda.pydata.org/docs>`_.

To install **Conda**, please refers to this `page <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html>`_.
Installers for:

* **Miniconda** are available on this `page <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_.
* **Anaconda** are available on this `page <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_.

.. note::

    We recommend to:
    
    * Follow the instructions given for the regular installation.
    * Install **Miniconda** if you are only interested by **Statiskit**.
    * Install **Miniconda 3** or **Anaconda 3** since the supported version of **Statiskit** is based on *Python 3*.

Test it !
#########

In a first stage, you are not compelled to install **StatisKit** on your computer in order to discover its functionalities.
Using **Docker** images, **Binder** servers and **Jupyter** notebooks, we are able to provide pre-installed interfaces with various examples.

.. note::

    For more information refers to :
    
    * The **Jupyter** `documentation <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
    * The **Binder** `documentation <http://docs.mybinder.org/>`_.
    * The **Docker** `documentation <https://docs.docker.com/>`_.
    
Online With **Binder**
======================

To reproduce the various examples from a **Binder** server, follow this `link <https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/statiskit/statiskit/master?filepath=share/jupyter/index.ipynb>`_.

    
On Your Computer With **Docker**
================================

To reproduce the various examples with **Docker** use these `images <https://hub.docker.com/r/statiskit/statiskit/tags>`_.
After `installing <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_ **Docker**, you can type the following command in a shell:

.. code-block:: console

  docker run -i -t -p 8888:8888 statiskit/python-statiskit:latest

   
Then, follow the given instructions.

.. warning::

    By default, on some operating systems like Ubuntu, docker require to have administration rights.
 Â   You can, for example, execute the preceeding lines after typing :code:`sudo -i` if you are on Ubuntu or follow these `instructions <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/>`_.
    
.. note::

  If your port :code:`8888` is already used, replace this number in these command lines and instructions given by another one (e.g., :code:`8889`).

On Your Computer From a SSH Server
==================================

To reproduce the various examples from a **SSH** server, you can type the following commands in a shell:

.. code-block:: console

   ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 <username>@<servername>
   jupyter notebook --ip='*' --port=8888 --no-browser
    
.. note::

   The username on the **SSH** server (resp. the **SSH** servername) is denoted in the following by :code:`<username>` (resp. :code:`<servername>`).
   Please replace it by the appropriate username (resp. servername).

Then, follow the given instructions.

.. note::

   If your port :code:`8888` is already used, replace this number in these command lines and instructions given by another one (e.g., :code:`8889`).

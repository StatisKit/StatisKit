Complete the repository
=======================

For now your repository is created but empty.
You need to complete it in order to respect **StatisKit** standards.
If you used the :code:`statiskit create` command this will be done automatically.
To commit changes and push them into the remote repository you must enter a short commit message :code:`<msg>`.

.. code-block:: console

    Enter a brief commit message: <msg>
    
If no commit message is given, the default commit message :code:`Initialize and complete the repository` is used.

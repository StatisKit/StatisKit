Activate repository services
============================

If you look at the :code:`README.rst` file of the created repository, some web-services must be activated in order to obtain to respect **StatisKit** standards.
These services are:

* **Travis CI**.
  This `service <https://docs.travis-ci.com/>`_ is used to perform continuous integration of repositories.
* **Coveralls**.
  This `service <https://coveralls.zendesk.com/hc/en-us>`_ is used to show which parts of your code aren't covered by repository test suites.
* **Landscape**.
  This `service <https://docs.landscape.io/index.html>`_ is used to perform static analysis of your code within repositories.
* **Read The Docs**.
  This `service <http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is used to ensure that documentation of your code is uploaded to repository documentation websites.
